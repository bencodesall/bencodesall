## Greetings

My name is Ben 👋. Amongst many other roles, I am a professional Software Engineer. 🛠️

If you have landed on this page, I will assume you want to know more about me.

***Quick Note**: Most of my code activity over the past 2 years has almost exclusively been for work and lives in a "work" account ([here](https://github.com/rv-bnowak)) with no publicly accessible repos. If you are a hiring manager and looking for code samples, please contact me directly.*

## Introductory Info

A few "metrics" for consideration.

### Personality

While I don't usually like general categories for people, especially myself, I do find it useful info to share. Do with them what you will, but understand they don't define me. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

- Myers-Briggs
  - [I/ESTJ](https://www.truity.com) at work
  - [INFP/TJ](https://www.truity.com) outside of work
- [DiSC](/images/discmap.png)
  - DC *(Dominance/Conscientiousness)* : Direct, Firm, Results-oriented, Analytical, Reserved, Precise, Private, Systematic
- Gallup Strengths Finder
  - Learner, Inputs, Intellection, Strategic, Belief
- Eniagram
  - people say I'm a solid 5. _I firmly reject this "personality" test, out-of-hand, because it is directly descended from occult, numerological, esoteric systems developed by Gurdjieff-ian mysticism._

## Technologies and Languages

Being concise here is tough, since there are **A LOT** of general programming languages and other tools that I've had touchpoints with over my career to this point!

These are the things I use on an almost daily basis at work, and in my personal projects.

### Secondary

If I work in it occassionaly and/or am interested in it, it's in this list

## Tools and IDEs

Here are the tools I use personally and professionally

### Hardware

I have generally leaned towards *macOS*. For me it provides a good balance of very good developer experience, solid multimedia production support, and flexibility through tooling.

Although, being truly platform agnostic, **I am neither a *macOS* or *Windows* "person"**.

I like *debian, FreeBSD, and Lubuntu* flavors of Linux. I will use Windows if forced too (i.e. gaming, or work). I am quite proficient in just about any mainline environment, and a few less visible ones (SCO Linux anyone?) :wink:

### Software

- JetBrains Toolbox (IntelliJ, WebStorm, Goland, PyCharm, DataGrip, etc.)
- Tower (git client)
- iTerm
- vim
- VisualStudio Code
- Adobe CC (XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, AfterEffects)
- Figma
- ScreamingFrog SEO Spider
- Postman
- massCode

## Other Roles / Interests

In addition to being a professional Software Engineer, I am also engaged in a handful of other roles either quasi-professionally, or "just for fun."

- Son / Father
- Armchair Theologian/Philosopher
- Musician / Producer
- 3D CAD and Modeling Amateur
- Fisherman
- Aspiring Outdoors-person
- Flailing (non-practicing) Brew Master
