### Greetings

My name is Ben 👋. Amongst many other roles, I am a professional Software Engineer. 🛠️

If you have landed on this page, I will assume you want to know more about me.

***Quick Note**: I am in process of consolidating and cleaning up personal accounts. Most of my code activity over the past 2 years lives in a non-public "organizational" account. If you are a hiring manager and looking for code samples, please contact me directly.*

## Technologies and Languages

Being concise here is tough, since there are **A LOT** of general programming languages and other tools that I've had touchpoints with over my career to this point!

## Tools and IDEs

Here are the tools I use personally and professionally

### Hardware

I have generally leaned towards *macOS*. For me it provides a good balance of very good developer experience, solid multimedia production support, and flexibility through tooling.

Although, being truly platform agnostic, I am neither a *macOS* or *Windows* "person".

I like *debian, FreeBSD, and Lubuntu* flavors of Linux. I will use Windows if forced too (i.e. gaming, or work). I am quite proficient in just about any mainline environment, and a few less visible ones (SCO Linux anyone?) :wink:

### Software

- JetBrains Toolbox (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm, DataGrip, etc.)
- Tower (git client)
- iTerm
- VisualStudio Code
- Adobe CC (XD, Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, AfterEffects)
- Figma
- ScreamingFrog SEO Spider
- Postman
- massCode

## Other Roles / Interests

In addition to being a professional Software Engineer, I am also engaged in a handful of other roles either quasi-professionally, or "just for fun."

- Son / Husband / Father
- Armchair Theologian/Philosopher
- Deacon
- Fisherman
- Aspiring Outdoors-person
- Flailing (non-practicing) Brew Master
- Scale Modeler
- Wannabe DIY-er / Maker
