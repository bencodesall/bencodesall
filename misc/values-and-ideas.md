### Words Have Meaning

Semantics. To classically trained Computer Scientists, this word 'semantic' is a very strong qualifier. Both in specific languages and the practice of the art. In computers, semantics are very important.

I assert that semantic meaning is exceedingly important in communication. "It's just semantics." The phrase makes me cringe. Loose linguistic semantics has been a detrimental practice in the braoder public arena for quite a long time. However, with the rise of media-centric group think, the acceleration of redefinitions, whether arbitrarily reimagined, or inaccurately redefined, is eroding cognitively foundational morays of social cohesion. The assertion that post-modern relativistic theories of meaning apply to th language we use or the definitions we give to words of singularly absurd.

"Bad", meaning good, or "fly" meaning sublimely acceptable, by example, are one thing. (Technically incorrect and confusing to those untrained in cultural vernacular.) Calling a political sub-group "evangelical" or referring to a totalizing narrative as "critical" is a fundamental obfuscation of rational meaning.

While it is a "pet" peave of mine, I recognize that it is useless to expect an en masse, wholesale readjustment back into classical conformity of accepted meanings for much of the vocabulary that holds weight in the econmomy of social discourse, cultural philosophy, and "issues of the day". As such, I ask forgiveness if my usage of a word may not comport with your historic understandings. If such is the case, please do not hesitate to engage me in clarification and definition of terms. I have also been affected by this, and am in recovery.

### The Workplace vs Individual Dialogue

So, ... I reject the "status quo" notion that you don't talk religion and politics with co-workers or "at work". To do so effectively dehumanizes the worker, devalues individual choice, and creates lack of understanding which can lead to fear. Fear is a manifold horrific landmine in the economy of trust and cooperation necessary for meaningful human effort.

To be clear here. Work is not the place to hold "court" on such matters, but to exclude serendipitous conversations about such things, I would argue, is not necessarily helpful, and in the extreme can become toxic.

I believe that corporations and companies should (generally) be about the business of doing their business while maintaining a neutral position (as much as is possible) about many social, cultural, and global "issues" that are tightly coupled to particular stances of politics and religion. Corporations and companies stand more to gain from alignment with contemporary sentiment and political maneuvering than private individuals commensurately stand to lose in this sphere.

I would argue that this is the most pernicious travesty of our contemporary era. It has engendered the loss of civic discourse, individual choice of personal convictions, and assurance of safety when exercising democratic free speech.

People have the ability to stand back, reason through, engage in debate, and form informed worldviews. Companies don't.

- Companies do not have the luxury (nor, I would argue, the ability) to stand back, reason through, engage in dabate and form reasonably informed worldviews. People do.
- Corporations and companies do not foster the free and open exchange of ideas, protect the dignity of individuals, or honor heroes. People do.
- Businesses do not (in any technical sense) hold moral compasses, develop complex and nuanced worldviews, or engage in ethical behavior. People do.
- Companies don't have families, social circles, and all the appurtenances involved with being living sentient creatures (faith, belonging, mental health, bodily health, etc). People do.

In light of this, I believe that it is imperitive that people (not companies) are empowered to excercise the ability to engage in constructuve social dialogue, free from retaliatory threats or coercion (neither explicit nor implied).

### General Political Philosophical Identifications

I am for the most part a Classical Liberal with strong leanings towards Libertarian views on social issues.

- I am generally a fiscal conservative, except when it pertains to the truly disadvantaged and needy. We should be above simply generous when people are in actual need, and we have the ability to help. I also don't feel super great about corporations having "individual" rights similar to actual humans (not clear on this, just doens't sit 100%).
- I am a staunch classical libertarian on social issues. Government, in so far as it may seek to be authorized to enact punitive legislative devices to coerce conformity with prevailing social norms, should be limited to the absolute extreme. People can do what they want, within reason, without the need for the state to regulate and/or mandate social behavior.
- I am a conscientious abstainer when it comes to pontification and/or consideration regarding foreign policy activity. The world is a complex system of governments, cultures, and geographies. I don't have enough information, don't get paid enough, nor hav the energy to form a clear opinion.
- I am a classical liberal (read staunch conservative in the non-essentials and less concervative otherwise) when it comes to matters of domestic policy. Basically if it's not a piece of critical infrastructure, spend as little as possible. If it is something that is essential to operations, be wise and frugal, but don't impede operations. Maximise transparency and observability. Be ready to adjust, but have great reasons to do so.
- Taxation ... ? Accross the board flat taxes. Full enforcement. Zero tax breaks except for homes with children in them, deductions for all interest payments, exemptions from all interest earned, and full deductions for rental/mortgage payments.

### Theological Understandings and Beliefs

I am a Christian who believes the tenants of the Reformed Protestant tradition makes the most sense according to scriptural exegesis. I am "technically evangelical", even though that word largely means nothing of real value in the context of public discussion (see [above](#words-have-meaning)). When asked, I will "give an answer for the hope" that I have, but the decision for individuals is between their own conscience and their maker.

There are two fundamental understandings that underpin everything for me. Not just in the sense of "religion" and "church", but literally ... every thing.

1. **Image Bearing** - Humans are created in the image and likeness of the creator, with accorded representative attributes. We all have inherent worth, value, and dignity. We have immutable characteristics according to how we were created. We have capacities for imagination, love, and will that reflect some of that image. We have a deep-seated desire to know and be known.
2. **Scriptural Relevancy** - "God's Word". Without needing to get into the technical details of what this loaded term means, I believe that the Bible is the personal, inspired, inerrant, sufficient communication from the creator that contains all the necessary elements to live out our lives (as best we are able) in a sanctioned and beneficial way for the human race. While many people ("believers" and "non-believers" alike) have a deficient understanding of what is technically contained in the bible and what is functionally expressed by those contents, the books themselves are gifted oracles of priceless worth and value.

### Truth, Simulacrum, Illusion and Delusion

"What is truth?" I've often wondered if Pontius Pilot had any deep personal understanding of the ultimate import of the question he asked, what the answer is, and how one goes about answering this one question. It is surely one of the "big ones", in terms of ontological and epistemological import. A few definitions might be helpful here.

- **Ontology** : Study of the nature of reality
- **Epistemology** Study of the processes around and structures used in defining truth

These are deep and weighty technical terms in philosophy. And these terms matter greatly. These areas underpin the reasoned and reasonable landscape of ideas when we talk about truth.
